## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install Flutter SDK from [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Install Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
3. Set up an Android emulator or connect a physical device

### Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Project Structure

android/                         # Android platform files
ios/                            # iOS platform files (for future iOS support)
```

## How It Works

1. **Input**: User enters text describing the type of videos they want to generate
2. **Generation**: The app creates 5 videos with different visual properties based on the input
3. **Display**: Videos are shown in a grid layout with a main player at the top
4. **Playback**: Users can tap any video thumbnail to play it in the main player

## Video Generation

The app uses FFmpeg to generate videos with:
- Different background colors for each video
- User input text overlaid on the video
- 5-second duration per video
- 720x480 resolution

When FFmpeg is not available, the app falls back to demo videos or placeholder content.

## Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:
- **Internet**: For downloading sample videos (demo mode)
- **Storage**: For saving and accessing generated videos

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Building for Release

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Flutter not found**: Ensure Flutter is installed and added to your system PATH
2. **Build errors**: Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
3. **Permission errors**: Ensure app has storage permissions enabled in device settings

### Demo Mode

If video generation fails, the app will use sample videos from the internet for demonstration purposes.

## Future Enhancements

- iOS support
- Custom video templates
- Advanced video editing features
- Cloud-based video generation
- Social sharing capabilities
